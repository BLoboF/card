			<p>Wolves are very intelligent animals. They have thick fur to help them survive in a variety of climates. They are found to live in many places throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Wolves live in small groups that are called packs. They can have from 6 to 20 members in them at a time. They have a very large range that they cover from 33 to 6,200 km<sup>2</sup>. They hunt as a group which makes it possible for them to take down large prey such as moose and elk. This type of kill helps to ensure there is plenty of food to go around for the entire pack.</p>
